# CHIP-8 Emulator

In the 90s, CHIP-8 interpreters began emerging for graphing calculators, with notable examples like CHIP-48 and SCHIP for the HP-48. I successfully developed a fully optimized CHIP-8 emulator in C++, capable of
running and debugging any given ROM file. This project passes with success chip8-test-suite and references can be find below this file.
